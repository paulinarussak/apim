\subsection*{Project 3}

Maintenance is the process we look at in the third project. Applying APIM, we need to start with Launch phase again. To convince the management that the process needs an improvement, we need to present them some data. We can collect measurement, based on the working hours of team members, how much time certain projects are without responsible team members - when some failure happens there is no person responsible for the project that can take care of the accident. To give an example: Jim and Mary are the only workers responsible for project A. During 40 hours workweek either both or one of them is working all the time, excluding time window on Monday where from 12 a.m. to 4 p.m., when none of them is working. This leaves us with 4 hours time window every week, so that if an accident happens, there is nobody responsible to take care of it. We can think of it as 10\% sign chance of this situation happening (this is of course a simplification which takes into account this 4 hours time window and 40 hours workween as the only factors). To further convice the management we can justify that having some services down for longer time can cause financial loss. We can give them real examples of situations that actually happened - like the need of calling the team members that were away on holidays to ask for help.

Brief action plan proposed for this process: \\
\textbf{Title:} Reducing total time of situations where services are live and no responsible team member is currently working.\\
\textbf{Problem definition:} Members of the team are working part-time and sometimes situations happen, that there is nobody to act in case of emergency situation.\\
\textbf{Goal:}  We want to reduce total time of situations like this happening.\\
\textbf{Team:} Project improvement team is needed. It should contain 2 people.\\
\textbf{People involved:} Development team.\\
\textbf{Strategy:} Knowledge about the projects should be spread across the team so that more members are aware of what to do in emergency situations.\\
\textbf{Desired Results:} Total time of service running without emergency help reduced to zero.\\
\textbf{Risk:} We can identify a risk that activities related to spreading knowledge about the projects across the team can take too much time (especially considering part-time workers) which can reduce overall productivity. Another risk is that hypothetically speaking there is a possibility that there still is no member responsible for the service (bad luck in schedule of workers so that nobody from the team is working at certain time, team members illness etc.).\\
%\textbf{Timeline and milestones:} \textit{tu nie rozumiem dok≈Çadnie o jaki timeline chodzi}\\
\textbf{Completion Criteria:} Total time of services without emergency help decreased to zero based on team members working hours.
 %To sum up our improvement process is about making improvement in planning part in development cycle. We want to monitor and schedule tasks flow in agile project to equalize the team load. The problem occur because of Product Owners schedule tasks for whole release using excel and because of that they miss the whole picture. Work for teams is unevenly distributed over project life cycle. The new monitoring and schedule method is needed.

Now comes Maturity phase. As described previously, we are following Maturity phase steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[Awareness] There is some hindrance in the maintenance process that sometimes causes too long downtimes of services in case of emergency situations. 
\item[Triage] .
\item[Resolution] .
\item[Training] .
\item[Deployment] .
\item[Trial] Collect data if measurement system works, if its need any improvements and where are we know.
\end{enumerate}
