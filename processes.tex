\section{Processes description}

In this section we want to present the processes that we find in our project and what improvements should be done. Analyze of improvements contains improvements descriptions and predicted obstacles.

\subsection*{Process 1}

First process comes from project that one of us was participate in a big telecommunication company as a software developer. There was a few processes in that project, but we want to focus on process that handle the tasks flow in the system. This project was running in some kind of Scrum. At the beginning of the release Product Owner (PO) gets a list of requirements that should be done till specified date by ten teams. Each team has 6-8 members. Product Owner was setting each requirement in preliminary order and attributed tasks to teams. Each team take care of one domain. After this initial settings Product Owner gives a list of requires that can be handle in this release to Product Manger and release starts.

Project is running in two-weeks sprints. At the beginning of each sprint Product Owner gives a list of requirements or User Stories to the team. Team make a Scrum Poker and based on velocity and intuition select the proper amount of tasks to the sprint. When Product Owner accept the Sprint Backlog, sprint starts. As was mentioned above sprint takes two weeks and included activities such as: develop, test, integration. 

After sprint finish, team meets the Product Owner and shows him the work that is done and undone, velocity and time that team spends on maintenance. After this review section teams goes to the Retrospective meeting and Product Owner update his scheduled list and prepare new requirements to the next sprint.

Let's focus on Product Owner work and process from his perspective in that case. List of requirements is delivered in excel files and this is the main tool to schedule tasks. Each requirement has estimated time execution time (in hours) and the domain that should be done in. Teams during planning gives the PO their estimates (in story points) and then after each sprint they gives the PO number of effort that left.  Some of requirements should be done in particular order, and some of tasks appears in project late (because depends on external work). So there is a lot of issues that PO should concern about. In project there are two Product Owners, so they have to schedule work for five teams each in excel.

Based on assumption above there is a problem in planning part. First of all PO have to spend a lot of time to schedule tasks properly in excel. He don't see the whole picture, because of size of the project, so there are situations that team have anything to do in two sprints, because some other tasks are late and then they have to work overtime. 

Our proposition to improve is to give the POs new tools to schedule tasks. This tool should help with daily work and take care about iteration work. There is one big obstacle: people have a tendency to do exactly what is on the tools output. To avoid that PO should gain at least two different way to schedule work. It force him to think about the proposed solution, alternatively add his own improvements and choose the best option. 

\subsection*{Process 2}

Both of us was participating is a university project about Scrum. We create a web solution system to handling bank operations. We work in group of six.
