\section{Experience}

Paulina was working for two and a half year as a C++ software developer in a big telecommunication company. She also worked there for one and a half year as a Scrum Master and was taking care about her team. She started working on improving big project, but because of personal issue she had to stop working on it. She is planning to come back to the project later. This project is described in details below (project 1). Paulina is also working in a small family company and is responsible for setting up the web projects and taking care about clients. She is also a student and one of the projects presented in this paper was project at the university where participants ran agile project in safe environment.

Szymon was working for almost two years as a DevOps/Software Configuration engineer in two big corporations. In both of these companies he worked according to agile philosophy. Having said that, software development processes in those companies differed a lot. One of the processes will be described as an example in following chapters. Szymon was also a member of Paulina's team in the agile project at the university and processes from this project are also described as a common experience of both authors.

In this paper we want to focus mainly on agile projects and concentrate on APIM and GQM+ techniques.
