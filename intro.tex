\section{Introduction}
Our main focus in this paper are two process improvement methods: APIM and GQM+. Process improvement is a continuous approach that provides elimination of weaknesses in the process. We need to improve processes to avoid unnecessary work or increase customer satisfaction. 

In section II we present our experience in software development projects. Section III contains three processes that we identified in the projects from previous part and issues in those processes that should could be resolved. Section IV is all about APIM model - here we describe how APIM model can be used in process 1 and process 3. In section V we present the GQM+ solution that could be used to improve process 1. Section VI provides information about similarities and differences in APIM and GQM+ methods. In section VII we describe a few tools that were presented in Jacob's book \cite{jacobs} and could be used in our process improvement cycles. At the end of this document there is short conclusion part where we contain the main thoughts about both methods.
