\section{Introduction}
In this paper we want to focus on two process improvement methods: APIM and GQM+. Process improvement is a continuous approach that provide removing the weaknesses in process.  We need to improve processes to avoid unnecessary work or increase customer satisfaction. 

In section II we want to present our experience in software development projects. In section III we want to present the three processes that occur in projects from previous part and find issues in those that should be improved. Section IV is all about APIM model - we describe here how APIM model can be use in process 1 and process 2. In V section we present the GQM+ solution that could be use to improve process 1. Section VI provide informations about similarities and differences in APIM and GQM+ methods. In section VII we want to describe a few tools that was presented in Jacob's book \cite{jacobs} and could be use in our process improvements cycles. At the end of this document there is conclusion part where we contain the main thoughts about both methods.
