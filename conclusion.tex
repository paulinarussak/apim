\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we present the usage of APIM and GQM+ methods in projects that we were part of. Both methodologies are based on continuous improvement philosophy and both are run in cycles. APIM method is more about making improvements in small steps what was taken from agile philosophy. GQM+ on the other hand focuses on measurements and deep understanding the purpose of improvement. These two methods are complementary, we can try to mix then and take the best out of those two. One idea that we find really valuable is trying to keep the processes and tools relatively simple and trying to avoid bureaucracy.
